# Final Project Ideation


When you intend to begin building a new application, it is vital to have a plan in place before beginning to code anything. There are multiple different viable approaches to planning out a project, but we will be utilizing a development process known as [Feature-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature-driven_development). Feature-driven development relies upon planning out the application as a list of features that your application should have.

Before beginning to plan out the individual features we want our app to have, however, it is important to have a concrete vision of what your application is, and who it's for (i.e. your target market). This summary should fit the following format:

`A _______ for _______ who want to ______________.`

So, as an example, let's pretend that we are designing Postmates. A possible application description for that could be:

A **dynamic web application** for **hungry people** who want to **get food delivered to them from local restaurants**.

Once you have decided upon your application description, it is time to start planning out the individual features that you intend for your application to have. Features are always described from the perspective of the user, and what they are able to do. As such, the format to describe a feature is as follows:

`User can _________________.`

As an example, let's continue to plan out Postmates, and describe some of its features in this format:

- User can view all open restaurants in their area.

- User can view the menu of a restaurant.

- User can add an item to their shopping cart.

- User can include a note with their item.

- User can pay for their order.

- User can view the progress of their order.

When planning out features, it can be difficult to decide what counts as a full feature, and what is simply a component of a larger feature. To help simplify this process, there is a test you can use against each feature you design known as **The Newsletter Test**. The Newsletter Test is simply a question you ask yourself once you have thought of a potential feature:

___If the company sends out an email to all customers announcing the functionality described in your feature, would the users care?___

For instance, consider the feature "User can view navbar". If you as a customer received an email from a company stating that their website now includes a navbar, would this email excite you, or make you want to cancel your subscription to their newsletter? If it is not something you would consider exciting to a user, it is not a full feature, and likely needs to be expanded upon.

When planning out your application, aim to create 10-15 features. This will likely not encompass every feature you could imagine for your application, but it will be a good jumping off point to begin your development/planning process.

Final projects can take one of two forms: a group project, or a solo project. When planning out your final project idea, consider which path you would want to follow, and plan the scope of your project accordingly.

Finally, while planning out what you want to build for your final project, it is important to keep in mind the ultimate objective of thi project: to have an application you can show off to employers to get employed as a professional developer. As such, the goals you are reaching for with this project are **not** building an application for your business idea, building a revolutionary application, or building a completely original application idea. Given that you are attempting to get employed after the conclusion of the program, your ultimate goals with this project are to ___solidify what you learned in the program___ and ___gain coding experience___. Work towards finding an idea for your final project that you are excited for, but you should primarily be seeking out an idea that will allow you to show off the skillset you have acquired in the program.
