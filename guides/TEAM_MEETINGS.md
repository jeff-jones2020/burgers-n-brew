# Team Meetings

Over the course of a project a software team will conduct regular meetings. Because developer time is so expensive and software development is such a time-consuming endeavor, it's important to be strategic about how meetings are structured.

This guide outlines some basics around conducting effective meetings regarding a software project.

## Daily Stand Up

Daily Stand Up is a common practice among software teams. It is called a "stand up" because attendees traditionally stay standing during the meeting. This tactic is intended to keep the meeting short because everyone is standing, waiting to get back to work (sitting). Some agile methodologies call this practice Scrum, named after how a rugby team huddles together at the beginning of a play.

### Overview

A well conducted Daily Stand Up is intended to achieve the following goals:

- Get everyone working toward the same goals.
- Re-balance workload so that team members don't stay stuck.
- (Briefly) call out difficulties and highlight achievements.
- Bolster team spirit.

The primary type of Daily Stand Up that we'll be conducting during your final project answers three questions:

1. **What did you do yesterday?**

    This can be as small as completing a few tasks on a MeisterTask card, or as large as finishing the front/back end portion of an entire feature. It's important to be as detailed as you can, so come to Stand Up prepared with your MeisterTask open so you can simply read from it.

1. **What are you doing today?**

    It's okay to be conservative here, but be specific. If you have a task list for your next MeisterTask card, then read the task list. If you don't have a task list, but know what feature or bug you're tackling, then say so. If you don't know what you are doing next, then state that you still need to decide what you're going to work on. A teammate might need some help so you can state that you're available to help.

1. **What is blocking you?**

    During the course of a final project, it is _exceedingly rare_ that anybody is truly blocked. More often, students are simply "stuck". It's okay to be stuck. Part of a developer's work is to solve problems that nobody else in the business is prepared to tackle. Often this involves being "stuck" doing research, reading documentation, or prototyping solutions. Voicing this during Stand Up is also okay. It gives your teammates an opportunity to chime in if they're available to help. It also helps manage expectations with your Project Manager.

### How It's Done

Before each Stand Up, open your task management tools (MeisterTask). Review your completed items carefully. When it is your turn to participate, answer the following questions:

  - Yesterday I worked on ... (read from your task management tools). Be clear and specific.
  - Today I am working on ... (read from your task management tools). Be specific and realistic.
  - MAYBE - I am stuck on ... and I am planning on getting unstuck by ... Be specific and ask for help if you need it. It's also worth putting your plan for getting _unstuck_ in your task management tools.

It's important to be concise and direct when checking in with your team. It's equally important to stay positive. Sometimes work gets tough, but everyone on the team knows that, so Daily Stand Up is not the time to complain about things.

## End-of-Day Check In

During your final project, a Project Manager (LFZ staff) is assigned to your group. End-of-Day Check In is your team's opportunity to do a small retrospective on the day's activities. As with Daily Stand Up, a major priority of this meeting is to keep it brief. That being said, you are still in a learning environment, so your Project Manager will help you maintain productivity as much as possible.

At Daily Stand Up, your team will have coordinated around goals and task for that day. At End-of-Day Check In, your Project Manager will review your progress and offer coaching.

An effective End-of-Day Check In helps your **Project Manager** answer the following questions:

1. **How organized is your team?**

    Your Project Manager will be giving you feedback on your team's ability to stay organized. This includes how well structured your MeisterTask is and how well you are maintaining it.
      - Are all MeisterTask cards well labeled?
      - Is the purpose of each MeisterTask card _clearly_ stated in its title?
      - Is there more than one "In Progress" card assigned to a single person?
      - Is anything "Done", but not in the "Done" swim lane?
      - Are you building more than the feature you're implementing requires?
      - Are you building something that is not in your Figma?

1. **How far did you get with today's goals?**

    The intent is to communicate with your team and Project Manager about what tasks were completed and what tasks were left undone. Some days rock and a bunch of tasks are knocked out. Other days, not too much gets finished. Things come up. Unforeseen problems arise, but everyone should know what's going on.

1. **Are your priorities helping or hurting you?**

    Sometimes we get caught up in tasks and goals prematurely. Occasionally re-planning the next day is in order. Based on today's progress, it might be wise to make slight changes in direction. Your Project Manager will advise you on what tasks or goals to focus on tomorrow.

1. **What are you going to mention at Daily Stand Up tomorrow**?

    Preparing for Daily Stand Up is best done the day _before_. This help keep Stand Up brief so your team can hit the ground running every single day.
